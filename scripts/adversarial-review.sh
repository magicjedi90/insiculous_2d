# Adversarial review loop between Claude Code and kimi-cli.
#
#   adversarial-review.sh plan <task-spec.md> --author=claude|kimi
#   adversarial-review.sh code <changes.diff> --author=claude|kimi
#
# One agent authors, the other reviews (whoever is not --author). Exactly one
# rebuttal round. All outputs land in review/ (gitignored transients):
#
#   plan mode: plan.md -> review-1.md -> rebuttal-1.md [+ plan-v2.md if revised]
#   code mode: draft.diff (copy of input) -> review-1.md -> rebuttal-1.md
#
# This is the FULLY-HEADLESS variant (both roles run non-interactively). For
# the human-in-the-loop variant where your interactive session (Claude Code or
# kimi) authors and only the review step is headless, use the
# `adversarial-review` skill (.claude/skills/adversarial-review/), which calls
# scripts/request-review.sh for the review step — as does this driver.
#
# Non-interactive invocation (verified against installed CLIs, Aug 2026):
#   claude: prompt piped on stdin to `claude -p`, response on stdout.
#   kimi:   prompt passed as an argument to `kimi -p <prompt>` (kimi-code
#           0.36+; the old --quiet/--work-dir flags are gone). Progress logs
#           go to stderr, the final message to stdout. No work-dir flag
#           anymore, so the invocation cd's into review/ to keep any tool use
#           scoped there; the prompts also instruct text-only. Linux caps a
#           single argv string at ~128 KiB, so oversized payloads fail loud.
