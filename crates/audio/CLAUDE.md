# Audio Crate — Agent Context

Audio playback via rodio (sound effects + background music). **No spatial audio
lives in this crate**: the ECS components `AudioSource`, `AudioListener`, and
`PlaySoundEffect` are in `crates/ecs/src/audio_components.rs` and are currently
editor-inspectable data only — no runtime system consumes them (a bridging
audio system is future work).

## Files
- `lib.rs` — crate docs + re-exports (`AudioManager`, `SoundHandle`, `SoundSettings`, `AudioError`, `AudioResult`)
- `manager.rs` — `AudioManager`: load/cache, SFX playback, music playback, volume buses, stop-by-handle
- `sound.rs` — `SoundHandle` (Copy id), `SoundSettings` (builder: volume/speed/looping)
- `error.rs` — `AudioError` (thiserror) + `AudioResult<T>` alias

## Key Types & Behavior
- `AudioManager::new_or_disabled()` — never fails; *disabled* mode (no audio
  device) still loads/validates sounds, playback no-ops. In disabled mode
  `play_music*` returns `Ok` but `is_music_playing()` stays `false` (documented).
- Sound bytes cached as `Arc<[u8]>`; each play decodes from
  `Cursor<Arc<[u8]>>` — no buffer copy per play.
- Volume model: sink volume = `base * bus * master`, re-applied to all live
  sinks (music + SFX) by `set_master_volume` / `set_sfx_volume` / `set_music_volume`.
- Clamping happens at point of use (`clamp_volume` 0..=1, `clamp_speed` floor
  0.1) because `SoundSettings` fields are public.
- `play(handle)` / `unload(handle)` take `SoundHandle` by value (Copy);
  `play_with_settings(&handle, settings)` keeps a reference (external callers).
- `stop(handle)` stops all active instances of one sound; `stop_all()` stops
  every SFX (music unaffected). Unknown handles are a no-op.
- Music: `play_music` / `play_music_with_volume` loop forever;
  `play_music_once(path, volume)` plays one-shot. No crossfade.
- Errors: file-read failures are `AudioError::IoError` (`#[from] io::Error`);
  undecodable data is `DecodeError`; `LoadError` reserved for non-IO load problems.
- `unload` does not cut off already-playing instances (each holds its own Arc).

## Known Tech Debt
- All audio loaded eagerly into memory (no streaming for large music files)
- See `TECH_DEBT.md` for the full list

## Testing
- 21 headless tests (20 unit + 1 doc; disabled mode + bytes/temp-file APIs), run with
  `cargo test -p audio`. No audio device needed.

## Godot Oracle
- Audio architecture: `servers/audio_server.cpp`, `scene/audio/audio_stream_player.cpp`
