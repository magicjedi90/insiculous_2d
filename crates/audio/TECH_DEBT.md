# Technical Debt: audio — LIVE (open items only)

Last audited: June 11, 2026 (July 2026: Game Programming Patterns audit).
Resolved history: root `log_archive.md` § audio.

## Game Programming Patterns Audit (July 2026) — see root `PATTERNS_AUDIT.md`
- [ ] **GPP-L3 (Low, Singleton):** `SoundHandle::new()` uses a process-global `static NEXT_ID: AtomicU32` (`sound.rs:14-16`) — ids survive across `AudioManager` instances and can't serialize deterministically; move to an instance-local counter like `TextureManager`.

## Known Limitations (By Design — current constraints, not open work)

1. **No streaming for large files** — all sounds loaded into memory for instant playback
2. **No spatial audio in this crate** — `AudioSource`/`AudioListener`/`PlaySoundEffect` live in `crates/ecs/src/audio_components.rs`, editor-inspectable data only
3. **No audio effects** — no reverb, echo, or other DSP
4. **Single music track** at a time
5. **Disabled mode reports `is_music_playing() == false`** even after a successful `play_music` call — documented choice
6. **`IoError` carries no file path** — `#[from] io::Error` loses path context (decode errors include the path)

## Future Enhancements (Not Technical Debt)

1. Streaming for large music files
2. Runtime audio system bridging the ECS audio components (spatial playback)
3. Crossfade for music transitions
4. Audio effects processing
5. Generic bus/group API (currently fixed master/sfx/music buses)
6. Audio occlusion
